This app will help a user shop for specialty teas. 

We are a specialty tea house, and this is our retail site for our customers to purchase teas for in-home consumption.

As a user, I want to be able to:
Search for a tea by name
See a list of teas, and get more detailed info upon clicking “view more”
Filter teas by category
Users should be able to rate each tea


Stretch Goals:
E.g. As a user, I want to be able to:
Add styling
Add Dark/Light Mode
Users should be able to add a review
